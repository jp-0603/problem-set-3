The Warriors have had MUCH success in the past years. The Warriors starting lineup is pretty good as they won three championships in the last 4 years.
Their point guard is a three-point specialist and even some people call him the greatest shooter in the NBA. He is also known for his clutch factor. His most famous clutch shot was against the Thunder on Februray 28, 2016 where he hit a three pointer from 38 feet. He is also a two-time MVP, which one of them was unananimous. This  
Klay Thompson is a very accurate three point shooter. He works very well off the ball, working off of screens and plays. He also complements Stephen Curry.
Kevin Durant was signed to the Warriors on July 4, 2016. The Thunder lost in the 2015-2016 season in the Western Conference Finals to the Warriors. The Thunder were leading the series 3-1 and the Warriors went on a streak to win three games in a row. Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors after the season ended. Many people view him a weak superstar as he went to join the team that beat his team in the playoffs. However, he helped the Warriors to win two rings and has recieved Finals MVP for both championships
Draymond Green is a defensive player rather than a offensive player. He is viewed as the most versatile player in the NBA. He can guard all five positions effectively. He also had the first triple double without recorsing double digit points. He had 12 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals on Februrary 10, 2017.
Demarcus Cousins had recently had a torn Achilles in January 27, 2018. It takes 8 to 12 months to fully recover this injury. He was very good before the Achilles injury. He played for the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2017-2018 season alongside Anthony Davis. New Orleans lost in the NBA Western Conference Semi finals to the Warriors with the series being 4-1. Cousins then signed a $5.3 million dollar contract for one year with the Warriors.

<p> Chris Paul has had a lot of experiecnce in the NBA. He is considered a very IQ player in the NBA. He played alongside another known very high IQ player(James Harden) in the 2017-2018 season. He also works very well with Clint Capela and can find the right man for every play.
James Harden is very skillful on the offensive end. However, his defense is not great but is slowly increasing. NBA players have said his stepback was very difficult to guard as it was quick and effective. He won the 2017-2018 MVP and it was very well deserved.
Carmelo Anthony recently has played for the Oklahona City Thunder but was traded during the offseason. He got wavied by the Alanta Hawks after the trade. He then signed a $2.2 million contract with the Houston Rockets.
